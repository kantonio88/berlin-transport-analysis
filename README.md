# Berlin Public Transport Analysis ðŸš‡

## Overview
This project analyzes simulated public transport data in Berlin to identify trends in passenger volumes and delays. It is intended as a beginner-friendly example of data analytics using Python.

## Objectives
- Explore patterns in passenger volume.
- Analyze average delays by station and time.
- Create visualizations to represent key insights.

## Tools
- Python
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

## Dataset
- **Source**: Simulated data
- **Columns**:
  - `Route`: The transport route (e.g., U1, U2).
  - `Station`: Major Berlin stations.
  - `Passenger_Count`: Number of passengers.
  - `Delay_Minutes`: Delay in minutes.
  - `DateTime`: Timestamp of the record.

## Key Findings
1. **Passenger Trends**: Route U4 has the highest average passengers.
2. **Delays**: Average delays across stations are minimal (~1.2 minutes).
3. **Hourly Trends**: Passenger volumes peak during commuting hours.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kantonio88/berlin-transport-analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook berlin_transport_analysis.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells to see the analysis and visualizations.
